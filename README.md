# Katas

The goal of this repository is to provide a space to work together on the [Katas from CodingDojo.org](http://codingdojo.org/KataCatalogue/), and share our solutions.

Each kata has its own folder. To keep it challenging for others, if you want to share your solution with the group, create your own folder, and commit your code there.

## Bank OCR

[Problem Description](http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/)

The Kata contains 4 user stories, which are largely independent.
